# Update 12/23/20
Sunpower killed off the old web-api (expected to happen now and then).  Did some digging to update this to make it useful.  I seem to have a failing panel and wanted to get the per-panel data (still available in components report!).  Pushed the fixes, used developer tools and https://github.com/jeffkowalski/sunpower thanks @jeffkowalski 

# Update 1/18/20
Added my new code fo the manager direct.  Also added my diamond collectors in their current state

# Update 12/30/19
Thier website has been very broken for months on end now.  Lots of data is missing from the graphs and they have a 'we'll fix it soon' which seems like a complete load of crap.  I've been contacting my installer and complaining regularly, its very frustrating and makes this data worthless.  Current solution for me is based on this: https://github.com/ginoledesma/sunpower-pvs-exporter

# sunpower
Sunpower offers no API (lame) but they seem to have a fairly usable api for their own apps
